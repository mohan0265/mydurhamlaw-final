## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files
```
src/pages/admin/SuperAdminDashboard.tsx    - Main admin console
src/components/ContactForm.tsx              - Contact form component
src/components/TriageAssessment.tsx         - Health triage assessment
src/pages/colonaive-demo.tsx               - Demo page showcasing features
src/sql/admin-crm-tables.sql              - Database schema for CRM
README-ADMIN-CRM.md                        - This setup guide
```

### Database Tables
The system expects these Supabase tables:
- `contact_messages` - Contact form submissions
- `triage_results` - Health assessment results  
- `seo_pages` - Content management
- `lead_tags` - CRM tagging system
- `ai_tasks` - AI operation tracking

## 🗄️ Database Setup

1. **Run the SQL Schema**: Execute the contents of `src/sql/admin-crm-tables.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
2. **Verify Permissions**: Ensure RLS policies are properly configured
3. **Test Data**: Sample data is included in the schema for testing

## 🔐 Access Control

The admin dashboard uses `withAuthProtection` and checks for admin/super_admin user types. Ensure your user profile has the appropriate permissions:

```sql
-- Update a user to admin status
UPDATE profiles 
SET user_type = 'super_admin' 
WHERE user_id = 'your-auth-user-id';
```
