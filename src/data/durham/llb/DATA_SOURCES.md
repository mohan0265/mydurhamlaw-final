## Rules used in YAAG

- Term windows are strict; events only render within Michaelmas/Epiphany/Easter ranges.  
- Exams/assessments are encoded as **all-day** unless an official time is published.  
- **No fabricated times** or weekdays; unknowns are left empty so the UI shows all-day chips.  
- Default Month/Week clamp to the first teaching period when the date is in vacation.
