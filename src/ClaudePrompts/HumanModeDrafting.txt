✅ CLAUDE PROMPT FOR BUILDING HUMAN-MODE DRAFTING™
You are now acting as the lead developer for the Caseway legal study platform, with full access to a Supabase/Postgres backend, a Next.js + Tailwind frontend, and OpenAI/Claude API integration. Your task is to implement a deeply personalized assignment writing feature called:

Human-Mode Drafting™ (Powered by Private Style Memory™)
This feature ensures that every essay, assignment, or submission generated through the AI assistant is:

Uniquely tailored to each student’s natural writing style

Undetectable by AI plagiarism detectors (GPTZero, Turnitin AI, Originality.ai, etc.)

Refined continually based on how the student writes and edits

Follow these 5 core instructions below:

1. Create the database schema
Design and generate the SQL schema to store each student’s writing history and build their style fingerprint:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- writing_samples table to store student-authored or reviewed samples
create table writing_samples (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid references profiles(id) on delete cascade,
  content text not null,
  title text,
  context jsonb, -- optional metadata (course, topic, etc.)
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- writing_embeddings table to store vector embeddings (1536-d for OpenAI, or as needed by Claude)
create table writing_embeddings (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  writing_sample_id uuid references writing_samples(id) on delete cascade,
  embedding vector(1536),
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
Create an insert_writing_sample_with_embedding(content, user_id) RPC that:

Inserts a writing_samples row

Calls OpenAI or Claude embedding API

Stores the vector in writing_embeddings

2. Integrate Private Style Memory™ into the Assignment Generator
When a user submits a prompt to the Assignment Assistant:
Query the 3 most relevant writing samples using vector similarity (e.g., pgvector’s cosine_distance)

Retrieve those writing samples as reference documents

Inject them into the GPT-4o or Claude system prompt like this:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
"You are generating a legal assignment for a student. Below are 3 prior writing samples from this student. Carefully analyze sentence structure, phrasing, vocabulary, and tone. Your goal is to write in this student’s unique style. Do not sound like an AI.

[SAMPLE 1]
{sample1}

[SAMPLE 2]
{sample2}

[SAMPLE 3]
{sample3}

Now write the assignment below in the exact same human tone and voice. Do not be robotic or generic."
Inject the user’s actual assignment question after that.

3. Feedback Loop Learning
After a user edits or revises a generated draft:

Allow them to click “Save as my style”

This saves the final version into writing_samples and updates their Private Style Memory

Optionally prompt: “Was this AI-generated draft close to your natural voice?” with thumbs up/down → used for future weighting.

4. Frontend UI Design for Student
On the Assignment Assistant page:

Add a section called “Private Style Memory™”

Show the 3 most recent writing samples used

Allow users to delete old samples

Option to upload new samples (e.g. past essays in plain text)

Toggle “Use Human-Mode Drafting™” on/off (default ON)

Display a friendly note:

"We’ll match how you write — every time. Your writing style is privately remembered and applied, so no two drafts are ever alike."

5. Admin/Instructor Tooling (Optional for later)
Create a dashboard to view per-user writing embeddings (to debug or improve models), but keep content private unless user consents.

Final Notes:

Default model should be GPT-4o (or Claude 3 Opus if preferred)

The goal is non-AI-detectable, deeply personalized, plagiarism-free writing output

The system must never reuse the same samples blindly — always retrieve embeddings by similarity
