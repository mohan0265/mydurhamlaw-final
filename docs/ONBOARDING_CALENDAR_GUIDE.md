## Alternative Sources

If Blackboard doesn't provide an ICS export, you can also export from:

1. **Durham Email Calendar** (Outlook/Gmail)
   - Open your Durham email calendar
   - Settings → Export calendar as .ics
   
2. **Durham Timetable System**
   - Check if your department provides ICS export
