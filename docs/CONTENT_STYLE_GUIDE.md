# MyDurhamLaw Content Style Guide

## Core Rule: Naming & Independence

**MyDurhamLaw is an independent study companion.** We must never imply that we _are_ Durham University, nor that we speak on their behalf.

### The "Durham" Rule

1.  **Generic Headings (H1/H2/H3)**:
    - **Bad**: "Why Speaking Matters at Durham"
    - **Good**: "Why Speaking Matters in Law School"
    - **Good**: "How to Prepare for Tutorials"

2.  **Allowed "Durham" Usage**:
    - **SEO Metadata**: Title tags, meta descriptions, Open Graph tags.
    - **Audience Anchors**: _One_ precise line near the top of a page/article.
      - _Example_: "Written for Durham Law students using MyDurhamLaw."
    - **Disclaimers**: "Not affiliated with or endorsed by Durham University."
    - **"Journey" Phrasing**: "Designed for the Durham Law journey."

3.  **Prohibited Phrasing**:
    - Never use "at Durham" in headings.
    - Never say "Durham requires..." or "Durham expects..." (unless quoting a policy).
    - Never attribute our tools to the University (e.g., "Durham's Speak Law framework" is FALSE; "MyDurhamLaw's Speak Law framework" is TRUE).

### Approved Snippets

**Audience Anchor**:

> "For Durham Law students. MyDurhamLaw is independent and not affiliated with or endorsed by Durham University."

**Disclaimer (Footer/Hero)**:

> "MyDurhamLaw is an independent study companion. Not affiliated with or endorsed by Durham University."

### Video & Narration Scripts

- Keep narration generic ("When you are in a tutorial...").
- Use "Durham Law students" _only_ in the intro/outro or context setting ("This method helps Durham Law students...").
